The sequence of tests based on the Harvard test above:

Block 1 of 7: Dolphins to left, sharks to right

Block 2 of 7: Unpleasant to left, pleasant to right

Block 3 of 7: Dolphins and unpleasant to left, sharks and positive to right

Block 4 of 7: Same as block 3

Block 5 of 7: Sharks to the left, dolphins to the right

Block 6 of 7: Sharks and unpleasant to left, dolphins and positive to right

Block 7 of 7:  Same as block 7

There does need to be 'correct' answers, however this is will not impact their score. If a person gets 15 or more incorrect answers, their test is thrown out.
